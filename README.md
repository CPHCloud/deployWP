##Deployment plugin for Wordpress

Wordpress is a great platform in many ways, but one of the places where it is seriously lacking is in how it handles development in multiple environments. Often times the developer will end up repeating the same tasks in both development, testing and production environemnts. We need an automated and modularized framework for handling these tasks. We need a build system.

####Introducing deployWP
While still in its infancy the ambition is that this plugin will provide the proper functionality to maintain deployments across multiple environments. deployWP does not in itself do anything to assist the developer but is merely a framework which can be extended by modules that take care of specialised tasks in relation to deployment and build processes.
